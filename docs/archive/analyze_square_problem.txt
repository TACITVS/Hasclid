# Why square_3_lines_proof.euclid Is Hard

## The Problem:
- Points: A(0,0), B(S,0), C(S,S), D(x,y)
- Constraints:
  1. dist²(C,D) = S²  →  (x-S)² + (y-S)² = S²
  2. BC ⊥ CD        →  (0,S)·(x-S,y-S) = 0  →  S(y-S) = 0  →  y = S
- Goal: dist²(D,A) = S²  →  x² + y² = S²

## After Substitution (y=S):
- From constraint 2: y = S
- Substitute into constraint 1: (x-S)² + (S-S)² = S²
  →  (x-S)² = S²
  →  x-S = ±S
  →  x = 0 or x = 2S

## Counter-example:
- D = (2S, S) satisfies BOTH constraints
- But dist²(D,A) = (2S)² + S² = 5S² ≠ S²
- Therefore: DISPROVEN (should be instant!)

## Why Wu/Gröbner Are Slow:
- Both try to symbolically manipulate polynomials
- Variables: x, y, S (3 variables with symbolic parameter)
- Polynomial degrees get high
- Exponential complexity even though answer is simple!

## What's Needed: SMART GEOMETRIC REASONING
