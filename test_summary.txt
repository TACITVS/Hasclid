CAD Week 1 Stress Test - Partial Results Analysis
==================================================

Tests Completed: ~10 (stopped at Test 2.4 due to parse error)

SECTION 1: MULTIVARIATE INEQUALITIES
-------------------------------------
Test 1.1 (x^2 + y^2 >= 0):         ✅ PROVED (CAD 2D)
Test 1.2 (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 >= 0):   ❌ NOT PROVED (Routed to Gröbner incorrectly!)
Test 1.3 (2x^2 + 3y^2 >= 0):       ✅ PROVED (CAD 2D)
Test 1.4 (x^2 + xy + y^2 >= 0):    ✅ PROVED (CAD 2D)
Test 1.5-1.8: Not reached (parse errors with <=)

SECTION 2: GEOMETRIC INEQUALITIES
----------------------------------
Test 2.1 (Triangle inequality):    ❌ NOT PROVED
Test 2.2 (Triangle symbolic):      ❌ NOT PROVED  
Test 2.3 (Distance >= 0):          ✅ PROVED (CAD 4D!)
Test 2.4+: Stopped (parse error with <=)

KEY FINDINGS:
============
✅ CAD IS WORKING for supported cases (4/7 passed = 57%)
❌ ROUTING ISSUE: 3-variable positivity went to Gröbner instead of CAD
✅ CAD handled 4D problem successfully (Test 2.3)
❌ Triangle inequality still not working
🐛 Parse error: <= operator not supported (need to fix test file)

STATUS: Need to fix test file and re-run!
