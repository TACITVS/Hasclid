> :assume (= a b)
Assumed: (= a b)

> :assume (= b c)
Assumed: (= b c)

> :prove-unified (= a c)
Unified Orchestrator Result: Proved
GROEBNER BASIS ALGEBRAIC PROOF DEVELOPMENT:
========================================
Used Assumptions (2):
   * (= a b)
   * (= b c)

Proof Logic and Algebraic Steps:
   1. Reduced expression to normal form: 0 (IDENTITY VERIFIED)

Canonical Basis Size: 2 polynomials
========================================
OVERALL RESULT: [PROVED]

> :reset
Theory reset.

> :point A 0 0
Defined 2D Point A at (0, 0)

> :point B 4 0
Defined 2D Point B at (4, 0)

> :assume (= (midpoint A B M) 0)
Assumed: (= (midpoint A B M) 0)

> :prove-unified (= (dist2 A M) (dist2 M B))
Unified Orchestrator Result: Proved
GROEBNER BASIS ALGEBRAIC PROOF DEVELOPMENT:
========================================
Used Assumptions (1):
   * (= (midpoint A B M) 0)

Proof Logic and Algebraic Steps:
   1. Applied geometric constraint: (= xM 2)
   2. Applied geometric constraint: (= yM 0)
   3. Reduced expression to normal form: 0 (IDENTITY VERIFIED)

Canonical Basis Size: 0 polynomials
========================================
OVERALL RESULT: [PROVED]
