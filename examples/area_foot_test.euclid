; Test Area Method PointFoot construction derivation
; D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC.
; We assert this using declarative constraints.

:assume (= (collinear B C D) 0)
:assume (= (perpendicular A D B C) 0)

; Prove that D is indeed the foot (trivial check of the construction logic)
; The Area Method should construct D as (PointFoot D A B C)
; And then eliminate the goal.
