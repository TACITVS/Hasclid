; Level 4: Nine-Point Circle (Simplified - Equal Distances)
; Prove that the three midpoints of a triangle's sides are equidistant from a common center.
; This proves they lie on a circle (the nine-point circle).

; Use a concrete right triangle for simplicity
:point A 0 0
:point B 4 0
:point C 0 3

; Midpoints of the three sides
:point Mab xMab yMab
:point Mbc xMbc yMbc
:point Mca xMca yMca

:assume (= (midpoint A B Mab) 0)
:assume (= (midpoint B C Mbc) 0)
:assume (= (midpoint C A Mca) 0)

; For this right triangle:
; Mab = (2, 0)
; Mbc = (2, 1.5)
; Mca = (0, 1.5)

; The center of the circle through these three points (nine-point center)
; For a right triangle with right angle at origin, the nine-point center
; is at the midpoint of the hypotenuse divided by 2, i.e., at (1, 0.75)
; Actually, for a right triangle with legs along axes, the nine-point center
; is at (leg1/2, leg2/2) / 2 = (1, 0.75) for legs 4 and 3.

; Let's just prove that dist(Mab, center) = dist(Mbc, center) for center = (2, 1.5)
; Wait, that's Mbc itself.

; Better: Use circumcenter of the midpoint triangle.
; For the midpoint triangle with vertices (2,0), (2,1.5), (0,1.5):
; This is a right triangle with right angle at (2, 1.5)
; Circumcenter is at midpoint of hypotenuse = midpoint of (2,0) and (0,1.5) = (1, 0.75)

:point N 1 0.75

:set-timeout 180
; Prove all three midpoints are equidistant from N
