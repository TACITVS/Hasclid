; Level 10: Erdos-Mordell (Concrete Instance)
; The general Erdos-Mordell inequality is too complex for the current prover.
; Prove a concrete numerical instance instead.
;
; Given a specific triangle and point P inside it, prove R_b >= r_a + r_c
; where R_b is distance from P to vertex B, r_a and r_c are distances to sides.
;
; Use equilateral triangle with side √3, centered at origin:
; A = (0, 1)
; B = (-√3/2, -1/2)
; C = (√3/2, -1/2)
; P = (0, 0) at center
;
; For equilateral triangle centered at origin with P at center:
; All vertices are at distance 1 from center
; All sides are at distance 1/2 from center
; So R_A = R_B = R_C = 1, and r_a = r_b = r_c = 1/2
;
; Erdos-Mordell: R_A + R_B + R_C >= 2(r_a + r_b + r_c)
; That is: 1 + 1 + 1 >= 2(1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2)
; That is: 3 >= 3 (equality for equilateral with P at center)
;
; Simplified concrete test: Prove R_b >= r_a + r_c for this configuration
; That is: 1 >= 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 (equality)
;
; To avoid fractions and sqrt, we use s^2 = 3 and concrete coordinates.

; Use a simpler concrete triangle: right triangle with P at a specific location
; A = (0, 0)
; B = (2, 0)
; C = (0, 2)
; P = (0.5, 0.5)
;
; R_B = dist(P, B) = sqrt((2-0.5)^2 + (0-0.5)^2) = sqrt(1.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.25) = sqrt(2.5)
; r_a = distance from P to side BC
; r_c = distance from P to side AB
;
; Side AB is the x-axis (y=0), so r_c = 0.5
; Side BC goes from (2,0) to (0,2), equation: x + y = 2
; Distance from (0.5, 0.5) to line x+y=2 is |0.5+0.5-2|/sqrt(2) = 1/sqrt(2)
;
; This is getting complicated. Let me use a simpler approach:
; Just verify that for these specific numerical values, the inequality holds.

:point P 1 1
:point A 0 0
:point B 4 0
:point C 0 4

; Distance from P to B
:assume (= RB2 (dist2 P B))

; Distance from P(1,1) to side AC (line from (0,0) to (0,4), which is x=0)
; Distance is |1 - 0| = 1, so ra = 1
:assume (= ra 1)

; Distance from P(1,1) to side AB (line from (0,0) to (4,0), which is y=0)
; Distance is |1 - 0| = 1, so rc = 1
:assume (= rc 1)

; Prove: RB >= ra + rc, that is, RB >= 2
; Since RB = dist(P,B) = sqrt((4-1)^2 + (0-1)^2) = sqrt(9+1) = sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16
; So sqrt(10) >= 2, which is true.
;
; Squared form: RB^2 >= 4
; We have RB^2 = 10, so 10 >= 4 is true.
