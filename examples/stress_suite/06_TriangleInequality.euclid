; Level 6: Triangle Inequality (Smart Squaring)
; AB + BC >= AC
; With Smart Squaring, this becomes (AB+BC)^2 >= AC^2 => AB^2 + BC^2 + 2 AB*BC >= AC^2.
; Which is AB^2 + BC^2 - AC^2 >= -2 AB*BC.
; If LHS >= 0, trivial. If LHS < 0, we need to square again.
; Hasclid's smart squaring handles the first step.
