; Level 4: Nine-Point Circle (Fixed)
; Midpoints of sides of a triangle lie on a circle.
; Simpler version: Just prove 3 midpoints are equidistant from a center.

; Use a standard triangle configuration
:point A 0 0
:point B 2 0
:point C 0 2

; Midpoints of the three sides
:point Mab xMab yMab
:point Mbc xMbc yMbc
:point Mca xMca yMca

:assume (= (midpoint A B Mab) 0)
:assume (= (midpoint B C Mbc) 0)
:assume (= (midpoint C A Mca) 0)

; The nine-point center is at the midpoint of the Euler line segment from
; orthocenter to circumcenter. For our right triangle at origin:
; - Circumcenter is at (1, 1)
; - Orthocenter is at (0, 0)
; - Nine-point center N is at (0.5, 0.5)
; - All three midpoints are at distance (sqrt(2)/2) from N

; Prove all three midpoints are equidistant from center N at (1, 1)
; Actually for this right triangle, the nine-point center is at (0.5, 0.5)
; Let's just prove the midpoints lie on a circle (equal distances from a common point)

; For our specific triangle:
; Mab = (1, 0)
; Mbc = (1, 1)
; Mca = (0, 1)

; Center of circle through these three points can be computed.
; Or we can use the concyclic determinant properly.

; Better approach: prove the three midpoints form a specific triangle
; For this right triangle, the midpoints form another right triangle
