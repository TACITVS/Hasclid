-- Test Wu's Method Branching
-- Hypothesis: x * (y + 1) = 0
-- This implies either x = 0 OR y = -1.

-- This polynomial is xy + x = 0.
-- It should factor into x and (y+1).
:assume (= (+ (* x y) x) 0)

-- Goal 1: Prove x * (y+1) = 0 (Trivial, but checks mechanism)
:wu (= (+ (* x y) x) 0)

-- Goal 2: A goal that requires the disjunction
-- (x^2 + (y+1)^2) * z = 0 ? No.
-- Let's just check the trace of the above to see "Branching Factor: 2"
