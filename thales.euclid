-- Prove: Angle inscribed in a semi-circle is 90 degrees.

-- 1. Setup Center O at origin
:point O 0 0

-- 2. Diameter points A and C are at (-r, 0) and (r, 0)
:point A -r 0
:point C r 0

-- 3. Point B is generic (u, v)
:point B u v

-- 4. Constraint: B is on the circle with center O and radius r
--    This means (circle B O r) must be 0.
:assume (= (circle B O r) 0)

-- 5. Prove: Vectors BA and BC are perpendicular (Dot Product is 0)
(= (dot B A B C) 0)
